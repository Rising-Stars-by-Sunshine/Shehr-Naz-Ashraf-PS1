# Code Documentation  

## File Overview  
- **eda.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook containing exploratory data analysis (EDA) for the UPGRADE-E dataset. The notebook loads the dataset, performs descriptive statistics, visualizes key variables, and examines adoption trends.  

---

## Workflow Summary  
1. **Import Libraries**  
   - Core: `numpy`, `pandas`  
   - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
   - Utilities: `warnings` (to suppress deprecation warnings)  

2. **Load Dataset**  
   - Reads the dataset from CSV using `pandas.read_csv`.  
   - Verifies structure with `.info()` and `.describe()`.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
   - Inspects variable distributions and missing values.  
   - Uses summary statistics for numeric variables.  
   - Converts selected fields into categorical types for consistency.  

4. **Visualization**  
   - `seaborn` and `matplotlib` plots to explore adoption rates across demographic groups.  
   - Bar plots, histograms, and boxplots highlight equity-related patterns.  

5. **Insights**  
   - Identifies relationships between adoption of solar, EVs, and heat pumps and factors such as income, education, and housing type.  
   - Provides visual evidence of disparities across demographic groups.

## Replication Instructions  

### Local Setup  
1. Install Python 3.9+  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
   ```
3. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook eda.ipynb
   ```

### Cloud Setup (e.g., Google Colab)

- Upload eda.ipynb and the dataset CSV.
- Run all cells sequentially.
- No additional configuration is required beyond installing the same packages.

## Reflection on Code Reuse

The notebook is modular and reproducible: it separates data loading, descriptive statistics, and visualization into clear sections. While tailored to the UPGRADE-E dataset, the workflow can be reused for other survey-based energy datasets by replacing the input CSV. For long-term reproducibility, adding automated data cleaning functions and parameterized file paths would improve generalization.
